## Goal:
Rotate through the entire gun card stack and reach the golden Knife.

## Characters & placement:
Each player starts with two characters and places them on each map as he wishes. The playing board is seperated in half and each half is themed around an Arsenal map. Providing some characters benefits so the players need to strategize.

## Turns:
Each turn the player may play an effect card¹ and must command an action upon each character card in that order.

### Effects:
Effect cards will be placed on the map, only (n) effect cards may be placed on a map at a time and playing an (n + 1) effect card will cancel the first effect card placed.

### Commands:
The player must command each of his characters
to perform one of these actions:

> Attack:
> The character attacks one of the enemy characters and may kill them. The attack damage is dictated by their strength stat and any effects it has applied on them.

> Attack with gun:
> The character is given the gun card and made to attack with it. The gun attack is the slowest in the game and will be played last in the turn taking (unless speed boosts are in effect). The gun has it's own damage and it ignores damage multipliers, both buffs and debuffs.
> 
> After the gun card is used the player must wait (n) turns until they can use it again.
> 
> Getting a kill with the gun card will grant the player the next gun card and allow the use of it in consecution until it did not achieve a kill. However 1 hit guns do not allow consecutive uses due to long deploy times and will be played last no matter any effect.

> Defend:
> The character can defend itself, resulting in the original damage it was supposed to take slashed in half². It cannot do anything else in that turn. A character may also not block (n) turn in a row.

> Move:
> The character can move to another map, switching with the character on that map. The character that initiated the move may not perform any other action but the played it switches with is allowed to play normally.




¹ playing an effect card is not mandatory. Also keep in mind that effect cards run out on their own.
² may be subject to change.
