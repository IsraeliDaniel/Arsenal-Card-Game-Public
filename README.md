# Arsenal Card Game

## Major Points


### Card Types
> The must card types are **Character** and **Gun**. Any other types can be suggested like consumables, event items and you can go even wilder like weapon specific cards that can only be obtained when a weapon is eqquiped.
>
> Like spell cards when you have the spellbook equipped.
>
> * **Character cards** make up your cast, think of each player as representing a team and their character cards are the team's players. 
>
>     Characters may have special traits, specific affiliations with roles or elements. Like Ace Pilot can be affiliated with the Love or Air element, or belong to the Cartoon role. Queen and King can be Royalty and Jester and Scarecrow Medieval or something like that.
>
>     Characters may also have special traits, like the King and Queen can have the [Royal Blood] trait that gives enhanced powers any Medival card in your cast. This can end up making some interesting cast combinations. Though I think it would be a hassle to balance.
>
>     Othen that these traits they can also have special weaknesses and a base HP number.
>
> * **Gun cards** wont be chosen by the players and instead given by the game's system, I still don't fully know how they will work but they decide how much damage your characters do. Some Character can have favorite weapons that they will maybe unlock an ability of it or get more damage.
>
>     The game should play out like Arsenal in the end, or atleast it's main gamemode should. You get a gun and kill a foe's character card to get another until the end.
